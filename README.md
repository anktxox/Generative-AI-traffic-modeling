# Generative AI for Urban Traffic Modeling

🛣️ A deep generative framework to simulate and predict urban traffic using GCNs, GRUs, and GANs for sustainable city development.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **GCN + GAT:** Encodes spatial dependencies in traffic graphs
- **GRU:** Captures temporal dynamics of traffic flows
- **GAN (VAE-style):** Generates realistic future traffic states
- **Losses:** Includes TRSC, TRPC, KLD, MSE, Simulation constraints

## 🔬 Key Features

- Multi-component traffic simulation using spatio-temporal deep learning
- Graph-based representation of traffic with edge features
- Generative Adversarial Network with encoder-decoder and reparameterization
- Constraint-based loss functions for real-world traffic realism

## 📊 Application

- Traffic flow optimization
- Road-block prediction
- Sustainable urban mobility planning

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python, PyTorch, NetworkX, torch-geometric, NumPy, matplotlib, Jupyter
